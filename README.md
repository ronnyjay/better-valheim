# Better Valheim

##### A 2-D take on the world of valheim with less input delay.

## Core Ideas
- 2-Dimensional
  - Art style inspired slightly by the likes of terria and valheim.
- Procedurally generated underground dungeons
   - Replaces mining through caves with a new form of exploration
   - May contain some form of boss
   - Contains loot, currency, food, etc.
      - Similar to bethesda games 
- Minimal Mining
  - Takes place above ground
  - Not a core mechanic
  - Should be some other form of item that acts as a similar reward to replace mining
- Crafting
    - Armor
    - Shelter (Walls, Stairs, Etc.)
    - Cooking
- Building
  - Basic structures
     - Type of structure depends mostly on the theme
- Nutrition
   - Not a requirement to eat to survive
   - Instead used as a mechanic to improve health during combat
